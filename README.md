# JS-All-basic

JavaScript is a client side scripting language that allows you to implemet complex things on web pages.

In September 1995, a Netscape programmer named Brandan Eich developed a new scripting language in just 10 days. It was originally named Mocha, but quickly became known as LiveScript and, later, JavaScript

Array : An array is a set of variables.

Variable : variable is a container that stores data and later we can use that value.

Object : object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is called a property.

Element : An element is a single part of a larger group.

JSON : JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax.

Hoisting : Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.

Recursion : Recursion is a process of calling itself. A function that calls itself is called a recursive function.

Let is block scoped. a variable declared in a block with let  is only available for use within that block.
Var is globally scoped. var is function scoped when it is declared within a function.
Const is block scoped. const remains the same within its scope. It cannot be updated or re-declared.

Exception : An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions.

Namespace : In the context of JavaScript, a namespace is a global object with a unique name that holds methods, properties, and other objects. Its purpose is to increase the modularity and reuse of code in web applications.
